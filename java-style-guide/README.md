# Java Style Guide

The style guide is split into multiple files for easier navigation.

## Editing

If you want to discuss some change, you can create an issue (from the issues tab). Or you can edit it directly by clicking the pencil icon at the top-right of the preview.

Note: the files are written in markdown. Markdown is just like plain text but with some added formatting syntax. [Here is a nice reference page.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples)
